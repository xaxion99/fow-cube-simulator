The gods powers were too grand, tearing the world at its seams. The gods thought it best to continue their war another way. Together they created a miniature world and agreed to continue their war through proxy using its denizens. And so, Valhalla had avoided annihilation... yet the proxy war continued with no end in sight.""","New Dawn Rises"

As the war raged on Valhalla reached the point of collapse and disappeared from the universe. The chief gods faded from existence, their essence scattered into the void. But the miniature world they created still remained. The people of this world still continued to fight, for gods that had long lost form. As time came to pass, they began to call their own world 'Valhalla'.""","New Dawn Rises"
